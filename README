# WolframAlpha Clojure Example

This simple project is a wrapper for the Java APIs for using Wolfram Alpha

## Usage

This project pulls some required JAR files from clojars.org and copies the rest from the local directory local_lib. I set the jars in local_lib as resources in project.clj.

Try this:

        lein deps
        lein repl
		user=> (use 'wolfram)
		user=> (query "pi")
